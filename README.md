1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 ABOUT THE SYSTEM

Amritarupan is a mobile application project, developed for the college, to simplify examination hall allotment and seating arrangement manual work. It facilitates to access the examination information of a particular student in a particular class. The purpose of developing this seating arrangement system is to provide a way to allocate exam hall for each student without any clash. Mostly students are facing many problems for finding the exam hall, so a newly invented concept helps for the staffs to generate their exam hall arrangement easily. This project also helps to view the allocated particular invigilator for particular hall. It is also very useful for the college where the software may generate the hall separation and concerned reports. Hence manual Excel sheet and paper work is automated based on their departments and register numbers. 

2.0 NEED FOR THE SYSTEM
The purpose of developing exam hall seating arrangement system is to computerized the traditional way of conducting exams and help staffs in allocating exam hall easily without any burden. Another purpose of developing this software is to generate the report automatically during exams at the end of the session or in between the session. This project also allocate particular invigilator for particular hall. It is also very useful for the college where the software may generate the hall separation. Hence the hall is allocated to the students automatically based on their departments and register numbers. We may also take print outs. This project also helps the invigilator to take the attendance to the students using 	QR code scanning.

3.0 BACKGROUND STUDY
3.1 EXISTING SYSTEM
Existing system is very slow and inefficient. Report generation is also not an easy task in the current situation. Also if the report is generated then calculations are done manually that leads to more errors. There is a lot of manual work involved in current system and mistake in one detail can lead to wrong generation of page. No proper collection of requirements leads a huge problem for this system. This system is to enhance manual work and also more energy is wasted to allocate the seating arrangement.
3.2 DRAWBACKS
The drawbacks that are present in the existing system are listed below:-
•	Current system is manual so all the records are maintained manually.
•	So the seating arrangement of students cannot be determined if updating is not done.
•	Time Consuming
•	 Less Efficient
•	 More manual Work Required 
•	Less Accurate 
•	Not User Friendly 
•	Difficult in hall ticket generation

3.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM
Amritarupan is developed for the college to simplify the allocation of halls and issuing hall tickets to students during exams. It facilitates to access the examination information of a particular student in a particular department. The information is sorted information alphabetically, which will be provided by the teacher for a respective department. This system is also help in finding the examination eligibility criteria of a student of the particular department.  

4.0 PROBLEM FORMULATION
4.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES
To develop a mobile application software on invigilation schedule management system and to reduce the manual work of assigning duties.
4.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES
•	To convert the present manual system to new computerized system.
•	To assign duties and update the system for administration.
•	For detailed view of duties to the faculty by duty schedule.
4.3 METHODOLOGY
A methodology imposes disciplined process upon software development with the aim of making software development more predictable and more efficient. In general terms the aim of a software development methodology is to make it easier to develop good quality software. In this model, the main change brought about by the iterative waterfall model to the classical waterfall model is in the form of providing feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases. The feedback paths allow for correcting errors committed by a programmer during some phase, as and when these are detected in a later phase.

4.4 PLATFORM SELECTION
Front End: ANDROID STUDIO
Android Studio is the official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development. It is based on the IntelliJ IDEA, a Java integrated development environment for software, and incorporates its code editing and developer tools.
Back End: PHP 
PHP is often used for database-driven web applications because it provides powerful tools and frameworks for working with databases. Here are some reasons why PHP is commonly used for database applications:
•	Easy to learn: PHP is a beginner-friendly language that is easy to learn, with many resources and tutorials available online.
•	Database integration: PHP has built-in support for interacting with databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and more.
•	Frameworks: There are many popular PHP frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and Symfony, that provide easy-to-use tools for working with databases and building web applications.
•	Server-side scripting: PHP is a server-side scripting language, meaning that code is executed on the server before being sent to the user's browser. This allows for more secure handling of sensitive data, like passwords and financial information.
•	Scalability: PHP is scalable, which means that it can be used to build applications of any size, from small personal projects to large enterprise-level applications.
Overall, PHP's powerful database integration, ease of use, and scalability make it a popular choice for building database-driven web applications.

5.0 SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
5.1 SYSTEM ANALYSIS
This analysis deals with the system functional performance that would result in the system, development of quality software. The considerations that are normally associated with the technical feasibility include development risk and technology. It also checks the performance status of the system with the proposed model.
5.2 FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
After doing the project Exam Seating Management System, study and analyzing all the existing or required functionality of the system, the next task is to do the feasibility study for the project. All projects are feasible – given unlimited resources and infinite time.
Feasibility study includes consideration of all the possible ways to provide a solution to the given problem. The proposed solution should satisfy the user requirements and should be flexible enough so that the future changes can be easily  done based on the future upcoming requirements.

5.2.1 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The system must be evaluated from the technical point of view first. The assessment of this feasibility must be based on an outline design of the system requirement in the terms of input, output, programs, and procedures. Having identified an outline system, the investigation must go on to suggest the type of equipment, required method developing the system, of running the system once it has been designed.
Technical issues raised during the investigation are:
•	Does the existing technology sufficient for the suggested one?
•	Can the system expand if developed?

The project should be developed such that the necessary functions and performance are achieved within the constraints. The project is developed within latest technology. Through the technology may become obsolete after some period, due to the fact that never version of same software supports older versions, the system may still be used. So, there are minimal constraints involved with this project. The system has been developed using java the project is technically feasible for development.
5.2.2 ECONOMICAL ANALYSIS
The developing system must be justified by cost and benefit. Criteria to ensure that effort is concentrated on project, which will give best, return at the earliest. One of the factors, which affect the development of a new system, is the cost it would require.
The following are some of the important financial questions asked during preliminary investigation:
•	The costs conduct a full system investigation.
•	The cost of the hardware and software.
•	The benefits in the form of reduced costs or fewer costly errors.

Since the system is developed as part of project work, there is no manual cost to spend for the proposed system. Also, all the resources are already available, it gives an indication of the system is economically possible for development.
5.2.3 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
Performance Analysis is looking at program execution to pinpoint bottlenecks or other performance problems such as memory leaks occur. Once the potential trouble spots are known, code can be changed to remove or reduce their impact. Performance Analysis services uses quantitative performance measurements and load testing strategies to assess the response time throughput of software under an expected load. Based on the result of these tests, we can recommend appropriate architecture and design level changes to ensure that users are getting the best level of services.

6.0 SYSTEM DESIGN
A logical system is built which fulfils the given requirements. Design phase of software development deals with transforming the client’s requirements into a logically working system.
6.1 INPUT DESIGN
Input design has to be dealt with the most important as it forms an integral part of the system design. A thorough system study and requirement analysis provides informants about the valid data.
The user interface is very important for any application. The interface design describes software that communicates between the user and the system. Input design is a pro
converting the user-oriented input into the computer-based format.

The well-designed input should serve the following purposes:
•	To control workflow
•	To reduce redundancy in recording data
•	To increase accuracy
•	To allow easier checking of data
6.2 OUTPUT DESIGN
Computer design is the important and direct source of information to the user. Efficient, intelligible output design should improve the system's relationships with the user and helps in decision making.

The various types of output required by the system are given below:
•	External Output, whose destination is within the concern and requires special attention.
•	Internal Output, whose destination is within the concern and requires careful design because they are user's main interface within the computer.
•	Interactive Outputs, which involves the user in communicating directly.
