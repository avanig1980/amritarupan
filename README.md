1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 ABOUT THE SYSTEM

Amritarupan is a mobile application project, developed for the college, to simplify examination hall allotment and seating arrangement manual work. It facilitates to access the examination information of a particular student in a particular class. The purpose of developing this seating arrangement system is to provide a way to allocate exam hall for each student without any clash. Mostly students are facing many problems for finding the exam hall, so a newly invented concept helps for the staffs to generate their exam hall arrangement easily. This project also helps to view the allocated particular invigilator for particular hall. It is also very useful for the college where the software may generate the hall separation and concerned reports. Hence manual Excel sheet and paper work is automated based on their departments and register numbers. 

2.0 NEED FOR THE SYSTEM

The purpose of developing exam hall seating arrangement system is to computerized the traditional way of conducting exams and help staffs in allocating exam hall easily without any burden. Another purpose of developing this software is to generate the report automatically during exams at the end of the session or in between the session. This project also allocate particular invigilator for particular hall. It is also very useful for the college where the software may generate the hall separation. Hence the hall is allocated to the students automatically based on their departments and register numbers. We may also take print outs. This project also helps the invigilator to take the attendance to the students using 	QR code scanning.

3.0 BACKGROUND STUDY

3.1 EXISTING SYSTEM

Existing system is very slow and inefficient. Report generation is also not an easy task in the current situation. Also if the report is generated then calculations are done manually that leads to more errors. There is a lot of manual work involved in current system and mistake in one detail can lead to wrong generation of page. No proper collection of requirements leads a huge problem for this system. This system is to enhance manual work and also more energy is wasted to allocate the seating arrangement.

3.2 DRAWBACKS

The drawbacks that are present in the existing system are listed below:-
•	Current system is manual so all the records are maintained manually.
•	So the seating arrangement of students cannot be determined if updating is not done.
•	Time Consuming
•	 Less Efficient
•	 More manual Work Required 
•	Less Accurate 
•	Not User Friendly 
•	Difficult in hall ticket generation

3.3 PROPOSED SYSTEM

Amritarupan is developed for the college to simplify the allocation of halls and issuing hall tickets to students during exams. It facilitates to access the examination information of a particular student in a particular department. The information is sorted information alphabetically, which will be provided by the teacher for a respective department. This system is also help in finding the examination eligibility criteria of a student of the particular department.  

4.0 PROBLEM FORMULATION

4.1 MAIN OBJECTIVES

To develop a mobile application software on invigilation schedule management system and to reduce the manual work of assigning duties.

4.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

•	To convert the present manual system to new computerized system.
•	To assign duties and update the system for administration.
•	For detailed view of duties to the faculty by duty schedule.

4.3 METHODOLOGY

A methodology imposes disciplined process upon software development with the aim of making software development more predictable and more efficient. In general terms the aim of a software development methodology is to make it easier to develop good quality software. In this model, the main change brought about by the iterative waterfall model to the classical waterfall model is in the form of providing feedback paths from every phase to its preceding phases. The feedback paths allow for correcting errors committed by a programmer during some phase, as and when these are detected in a later phase.
